###### A Place To Get Backgrounds For Mobiles
=======




###### GroundS is a small project I am working on in the past. This is a project that will perhaps be useful. At least for myself, and maybe for others as well.

### ❔What is the project about?

<p> The project is simple. You enter and you can find backgrounds for your mobile. And later for ipads and Computers.</p>

###### You must, of course, have the code downloaded.

### 📌 How to use?

<p>And then you have to type in your terminal <code>npm install</code></p>
<p> And it should install all the dependencies and DevDependencies that the project uses.
After that you can type in your terminal <code> npm run dev </code> <br>
<br>
And then you can open a new google tab and go to <code> http://localhost:4200 </code>
